Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Share buttons' options from differenc sources. Before using ![addtoany](https://www.addtoany.com/), I tried ![sharethis](https://sharethis.com/), that did not work well. Particularly, when loaded page buttons did not appear, only after resizing the viewport it was shown. I think there is bug.


### Continued development

I would try other sources for share buttons, to make my project design more similar to the challenge design. I will try to define what was the reason not showing buttons, while using "ShareThis" code.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.addtoany.com/buttons/) - This helped me to add share buttons very easy, that automaticaly allows you to share link on social media.
